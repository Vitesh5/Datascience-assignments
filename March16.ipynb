    "### Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Consequences include high accuracy on training data but poor performance on test data.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Use more training data, simplify the model, use cross-validation, regularization techniques.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: Increase model complexity, remove noise from data, provide more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.\n",
    "- Use more training data.\n",
    "- Implement cross-validation techniques.\n",
    "- Apply regularization methods (L1, L2 regularization).\n",
    "- Use simpler models.\n",
    "- Prune decision trees.\n",
    "- Use dropout in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Explain underfitting. List scenarios where underfitting can occur in ML.\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. It results in both high bias and low variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios:**\n",
    "- Using a linear model to fit non-linear data.\n",
    "- Insufficient training epochs in neural networks.\n",
    "- Using too few features or data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "- **Bias**: Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm.\n",
    "- **Variance**: Error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tradeoff**: Increasing model complexity decreases bias but increases variance, and vice versa. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes total error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Discuss some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting in machine learning models. How can you determine whether your model is overfitting or underfitting?\n",
    "- **Detection**: Compare training and validation/test errors.\n",
    "  - **Overfitting**: High accuracy on training data but low accuracy on validation/test data.\n",
    "  - **Underfitting**: Poor performance on both training and validation/test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Compare and contrast bias and variance in machine learning. What are some examples of high bias and high variance models, and how do they differ in terms of their performance?\n",
    "- **High Bias Models**: Simplistic models (e.g., Linear Regression on non-linear data). These models miss relevant relations and have high training and test errors.\n",
    "- **High Variance Models**: Complex models (e.g., Deep Neural Networks with insufficient training data). These models fit training data well but perform poorly on test data due to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Techniques used to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function for large coefficients.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Common Techniques:**\n",
    "- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds absolute values of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds squared values of coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "- **Dropout**: Randomly drops neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques encourage simpler models that generalize better to new data."
