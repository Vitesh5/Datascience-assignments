    "\n",
    "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "   - Outliers can pull the mean towards them, especially in larger datasets, as the mean is sensitive to extreme values. This can result in a misleading representation of the central tendency if the outliers are not representative of the majority of the data.\n",
    "   - The median, however, is less affected by outliers because it represents the middle value of the dataset and is not influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "   - The mode may also be influenced by outliers if they occur frequently enough to form a new mode or significantly alter the existing mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "   - Outliers can increase the spread or variability of the dataset, leading to larger values for measures of dispersion such as variance and standard deviation. This is because these measures take into account the distance of each data point from the mean, and outliers can increase this distance.\n",
    "   - The range can also be affected by outliers, especially if they are located far from the bulk of the data. This can result in a wider range that may not accurately represent the variability of the majority of the data.\n",

    "- Central Tendency: The mean salary would be significantly higher due to the outlier, while the median and mode would remain relatively unchanged.\n",
    "- Dispersion: The presence of the outlier would increase the variance and standard deviation, indicating greater variability in salaries. Additionally, the range would be much wider due to the outlier, even though the bulk of the data is clustered within a smaller range."
